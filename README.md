# Assets
Assets is a macOS app that manages assets for your developement projects (Xcode, web, etc)

## How it works - First run
1/ Choose a project root folder.
Assets will browse it and collect all assets

2/ Place Designer assets by either choosing a root folder or drag and dropping images.

3/ Click on Publish to replace all projects assets with the designer's assets.

4/ Save the file and reuse when new assets available.

## How it works - New Assets for your project.
1/ Open your saved assets file.

2/ If your new assets are in the same path as before and have the same names, simply click publish.

3/ If your new assets are in a different folder but have the same names, choose the new root Designer folder and then click publish.

4/ If your new assets are in a different folder and have different names, go back to first run.
